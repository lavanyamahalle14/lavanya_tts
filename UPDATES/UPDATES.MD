Issues Faced & Solutions:
* Backend-Frontend Integration:Backend returns JSON with audio file path; frontend sets <audio> source from this. No backend change needed.
* Timeout & Concurrency:Replaced signal-based timeouts with ThreadPoolExecutor to avoid errors in Flask/Gunicorn multithreaded setup.
* Resource Optimization:Reduced Gunicorn workers/threads, added garbage collection, input limits, and file cleanup to fit Renderâ€™s free tier constraints.
* Git LFS & Model Files:Solved Git LFS quota issues by limiting tracked files; recommended upgrading GitHub Pro and Render paid plans for better resources.
* Deployment Config:Fixed port errors and optimized Gunicorn config to ensure stable deployment.
Outcome:Successful deployment with reliable JSON responses containing audio paths, efficient resource use, and robust error handling.









CURRENT Issue Report: JSON Response Error on Render Deployment

Project Context:A Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application was developed with a backend that generates speech audio from text inputs and a frontend that handles user interaction and plays the generated audio. Locally, the application functions as expected. However, after deploying the backend on Render (free tier), the following issue was observed:
Error Message:"Error generating speech: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input"




Observed Behavior:
* Locally:
    * Inference completes in approximately 5 seconds.
    * Backend returns a valid JSON containing the audio URL.
    * Frontend fetches and uses the JSON correctly.
* On Render (free tier):
    * Inference takes around 10 seconds.
    * The JSON response is either incomplete or empty.
    * The frontend throws the above error due to malformed JSON.






Root Cause Analysis:
1. Increased Latency on Render:
    * Render's free tier provides limited CPU and memory, resulting in slower inference times.
    * This leads to delayed responses (10+ seconds), compared to the local environment (5 seconds).
2. Incomplete JSON Response:
    * The error indicates that the JSON response is not fully received.
    * Likely caused by an abrupt termination or timeout of the backend process before the full response is sent.
3. Render Free Tier Constraints:
    * 512 MB RAM limit
    * Shared and throttled CPU resources
    * 30-second hard timeout for HTTP requests
    * Cold starts and idle sleep behavior
    * These limitations increase the probability of timeouts and incomplete responses.







Recommended Fixes:


Short-Term Solutions:
* Limit input text length (e.g., from 500 to 300 characters) to reduce inference time.
* Add timeout handling in the frontend using AbortController to show user-friendly errors.
* Improve backend error handling to return valid JSON even on failure.


Long-Term Solutions:
* Upgrade to Render Starter or higher plan:
    * Dedicated CPU and RAM
    * Higher request timeout limits
    * Consistent performance without throttling
* Optimize backend code:
    * Lazy-load models
    * Offload inference to background tasks (using task queues)
    * Stream results if possible







Conclusion:The "Unexpected end of JSON input" error is primarily due to resource constraints and timeout policies of Renderâ€™s free tier. The application performs well locally but fails under limited resource conditions. A combination of frontend improvements, backend optimization, and infrastructure upgrades is recommended to ensure consistent and reliable application behavior.

Ah, you want a **prompt or commit message to instruct an AI agent (or teammate)** to make the required changes for deploying your Lavanya-TTS app on **DigitalOcean App Platform**.

Hereâ€™s a clear and actionable **agent prompt** for that:

---

### ðŸ¤– **Prompt for AI Agent or Teammate**

> ðŸš€ **Migrate Lavanya-TTS app from Render to DigitalOcean App Platform.**
> Please apply the following changes to make it compatible:
>
> 1. âœ… Create a `runtime.txt` file at the root with:
>
>    ```
>    python-3.10.10
>    ```
>
> 2. âœ… Add a `Procfile` with this content:
>
>    ```
>    web: gunicorn app:app --config gunicorn_config.py --timeout 120 --workers 1 --threads 4
>    ```
>
> 3. âœ… In `requirements.txt`, fix the PyTorch dependency:
>
>    * Replace this line (if present):
>
>      ```
>      torch==2.0.1+cpu
>      ```
>    * With:
>
>      ```
>      torch==2.0.1
>      ```
>    * Optionally add this above it if using CPU wheels:
>
>      ```
>      --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
>      ```
>
> 4. âœ… Remove any Render-specific configurations like `PYTHON_VERSION` from environment variables (they don't affect DigitalOcean App Platform).
>
> 5. âœ… Commit all changes and redeploy using the App Platform dashboard or CLI.
