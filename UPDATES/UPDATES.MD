Issues Faced & Solutions:
* Backend-Frontend Integration:Backend returns JSON with audio file path; frontend sets <audio> source from this. No backend change needed.
* Timeout & Concurrency:Replaced signal-based timeouts with ThreadPoolExecutor to avoid errors in Flask/Gunicorn multithreaded setup.
* Resource Optimization:Reduced Gunicorn workers/threads, added garbage collection, input limits, and file cleanup to fit Render’s free tier constraints.
* Git LFS & Model Files:Solved Git LFS quota issues by limiting tracked files; recommended upgrading GitHub Pro and Render paid plans for better resources.
* Deployment Config:Fixed port errors and optimized Gunicorn config to ensure stable deployment.
Outcome:Successful deployment with reliable JSON responses containing audio paths, efficient resource use, and robust error handling.









CURRENT Issue Report: JSON Response Error on Render Deployment

Project Context:A Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application was developed with a backend that generates speech audio from text inputs and a frontend that handles user interaction and plays the generated audio. Locally, the application functions as expected. However, after deploying the backend on Render (free tier), the following issue was observed:
Error Message:"Error generating speech: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input"




Observed Behavior:
* Locally:
    * Inference completes in approximately 5 seconds.
    * Backend returns a valid JSON containing the audio URL.
    * Frontend fetches and uses the JSON correctly.
* On Render (free tier):
    * Inference takes around 10 seconds.
    * The JSON response is either incomplete or empty.
    * The frontend throws the above error due to malformed JSON.






Root Cause Analysis:
1. Increased Latency on Render:
    * Render's free tier provides limited CPU and memory, resulting in slower inference times.
    * This leads to delayed responses (10+ seconds), compared to the local environment (5 seconds).
2. Incomplete JSON Response:
    * The error indicates that the JSON response is not fully received.
    * Likely caused by an abrupt termination or timeout of the backend process before the full response is sent.
3. Render Free Tier Constraints:
    * 512 MB RAM limit
    * Shared and throttled CPU resources
    * 30-second hard timeout for HTTP requests
    * Cold starts and idle sleep behavior
    * These limitations increase the probability of timeouts and incomplete responses.







Recommended Fixes:


Short-Term Solutions:
* Limit input text length (e.g., from 500 to 300 characters) to reduce inference time.
* Add timeout handling in the frontend using AbortController to show user-friendly errors.
* Improve backend error handling to return valid JSON even on failure.


Long-Term Solutions:
* Upgrade to Render Starter or higher plan:
    * Dedicated CPU and RAM
    * Higher request timeout limits
    * Consistent performance without throttling
* Optimize backend code:
    * Lazy-load models
    * Offload inference to background tasks (using task queues)
    * Stream results if possible







Conclusion:The "Unexpected end of JSON input" error is primarily due to resource constraints and timeout policies of Render’s free tier. The application performs well locally but fails under limited resource conditions. A combination of frontend improvements, backend optimization, and infrastructure upgrades is recommended to ensure consistent and reliable application behavior.

GitHub Copilot
Let me verify the Git LFS setup and make sure everything is properly configured:

git lfs install && git lfs ls-files
I see that Git LFS is initialized but let me check if the LFS objects are properly stored:

git lfs status
I can see that Git LFS is initialized but there might be no objects tracked yet. Let me check the actual files and ensure they're properly added:

git add -f Fastspeech2_HS/marathi/male/model/model.pth Fastspeech2_HS/marathi/male/model/config.yaml && git lfs ls-files
I can see that both files are now properly tracked by Git LFS:

config.yaml (77b4c91fba)
model.pth (91961837eb)
Let's commit and push these changes to ensure they're properly stored in the repository:

git commit -m "Add Marathi male model files to LFS" && git push origin main
I see that the Git LFS files have been successfully added and pushed to the repository. The model files are now properly tracked:

config.yaml is tracked with Git LFS
model.pth is tracked with Git LFS
Both files were committed and pushed to the main branch
However, I notice in the commit output that the files were newly created rather than updated. This suggests they may not have been properly tracked before. Let me verify the LFS pointers are correct:

git lfs pointer --check --file=Fastspeech2_HS/marathi/male/model/model.pth
Let me verify if the LFS files are properly stored in the repository by checking their content:

see the error - the Flask-CORS package is missing from your dependencies. Let me check your requirements.txt file and add it.







Based on the error logs and your application's context, there are several possible reasons for these errors:

Timeout Error:
2025-06-04 11:45:41,944 - app - ERROR - TTS process timed out
2025-06-04 11:45:41,944 - app - ERROR - Error in request processing: Speech generation timed out
Your application is running on Render's free tier which has strict resource limitations
The text-to-speech processing is taking too long and hitting Render's 30-second timeout limit
Large text inputs may be causing the processing to exceed the timeout threshold
404 Error for favicon.ico:
werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound: 404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on the server
The browser is automatically requesting a favicon.ico file which doesn't exist in your application
This is a minor issue and doesn't affect core functionality
Resource Constraints:
The FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN models are resource-intensive
Render's free tier has limited CPU and memory resources
Multiple concurrent requests might be overwhelming the available resources
Possible solutions:

Reduce the text input length limit (I see it's already set to 300 characters)
Optimize model loading and inference
Consider upgrading to a paid Render plan with more resources
Implement better request queuing to handle concurrent requests
Add caching for frequently requested text-to-speech conversions


The Starter plan ($7/month) with 512MB RAM is not sufficient for your TTS application because:

Memory Constraints:
Your FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN models require more than 512MB RAM
The error logs show continuous timeouts which indicate resource exhaustion
ML models typically need at least 1-2GB RAM for efficient operation
CPU Limitations:
Starter plan only provides 0.5 shared CPU
TTS processing is CPU-intensive
The timeout errors suggest the processing can't complete within the time limit
Recommendation: You should upgrade to the Standard Plan ($25/month) because:

2GB RAM (4x more memory than Starter)
1 dedicated CPU (2x more CPU power)
No spinning down after inactivity
Better concurrent request handling
To make this work on the current Starter plan, you would need to:

Significantly reduce model size (which would affect quality)
Implement aggressive caching
Reduce concurrent requests to absolute minimum
Limit text length even further
Would you like me to:

Help you optimize for Starter plan (with compromises), or
Help you configure for Standard plan upgrade?

I'll help investigate and fix the inference error. Let me gather some context about the inference process and error handling:

Based on the error message and code analysis, I can see that the issue is likely related to missing or improperly configured model files. Let me verify a few things:

 see the model files exist in the correct location. Let me check the content of the inference logs to see what might be causing the error:

tail -n 50 Fastspeech2_HS/access.log
tail -n 50 Fastspeech2_HS/access

I see that the model files exist in the correct location, but let me also check the vocoder files since they're required for the TTS process:

ls -l Fastspeech2_HS/vocoder/male/aryan/hifigan/
From checking the files and logs, I can see that both the Marathi model files and vocoder files are present in their correct locations. Let me now check the actual Python error output that might be occurring during inference:

Run command in terminal

cd Fastspeech2_HS && python inference.py --sample_text "नमस्कार, मी मराठी भाषेत बोलत आहे." --language marathi --gender male --alpha 1.0
Run the inference command directly to see the full error output


I'll help troubleshoot this deployment error on Render. This appears to be a path-related issue and potentially a permissions issue on the Render server. Let me check the relevant files to understand how the paths are being handled:

Based on the code analysis, I can identify several potential issues causing the error on Render:

File Permissions: The error occurs when trying to write to /opt/render/project/src/static/audio/. Let me fix this by ensuring the directory has proper permissions and exists before running the inference.

Path Handling: The code is using absolute paths which might be different on Render. I'll modify this to use relative paths.
